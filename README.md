# Fillet-O-Neumann with moves on the side

The simulation of a fictional processor design and architecture using Java. The design process involves choosing an instruction set and a certain execution paradigm,
and results in a microarchitecture. The mode of operation of any processor is the execution of lists of
instructions. Instructions typically include those to compute or manipulate data values using registers,
change or retrieve values in read/write memory, perform relational tests between data values and to
control program flow.
